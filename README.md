# Shell

Build a variant of a UNIX shell. Purpose of this work to learn about process
management as well as how mysterious things like pipes and redirects actually
work. Variants include unusual features, like a redirection symbol that also
compresses the output via gzip. Another variant is a batch mode which allows
the user to batch up a few requests and then execute them, perhaps using
different scheduling disciplines.</br></br>
